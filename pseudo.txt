read the list of credit cards file names from .txt file
read each credit card json file into a dictionary

display options
- display categories
- display merchants
- enter category
- enter merchant

based on entered merchant/category, go into dictionary by card
- loop over cash back percents and check for merchant/category match
- break once the highest-valued match is found

return best credit card

Ideas
-----
- create class for each card
-- encapsulate base rate, options card is best for
--- check the "5", "3", "2", etc of each card
- iterate over list of cards and compare against given input
- return best card
(probably better if there are multiple inputs in runtime)
