read the list of credit cards file names from .txt file
read each credit card json file into a dictionary

display options
- display categories
- display merchants
- enter category
- enter merchant

based on entered merchant/category, go into dictionary by card
- loop over cash back percents and check for merchant/category match
- break once the highest-valued match is found

return best credit card


-----
Ideas
-----
- create class for each card
-- encapsulate base rate, options card is best for
--- check the "5", "3", "2", etc of each card
- iterate over list of cards and compare against given input
- return best card
(probably better if there are multiple inputs in runtime)
- read through once, save the best to file (give refresh option)

Cleaned Card Data
--
File Type: class, tuple, dictionary
- Class: Merchants, Categories
-- how to encapsulate the card + percentage?
Tuple best option:
- make merchants and categories list
-- each is tuple with merchant/category, percent, card


-----------------
Remove Duplicates
-----------------
merchant list or category is passed in (assume merchant list for simplicity)
given_list := merchant_list
seen = []
pruned = []

iterate over given_list:
    if same reward location:
        if new is greater than current:
            remove current location, add new
            # use list.remove(Object)
    else:
        seen.append(iterated list)
        pruned.append(iterated list)
